# Bus-based-Cache-Coherence-Protocol-Simulator
Designed a simulator to model the MSI, MESI and Dragon cache coherence protocols used in a Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP) architecture using C++. 
Ran tests to study the trends and effects of the different protocols and cache configurations on the cache miss rates and memory transactions.
